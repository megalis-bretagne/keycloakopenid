# A brief description of what your plugin is doing.
summary: This plugin for Traefik allows it to authenticate requests against Keycloak. It utilizes the Keycloak's client credentials flow to retrieve an access token, which is then set as a bearer token in the Authorization cookie and as a plain token in a custom named cookie of the incoming requests. Optionally sets the Bearer token in the Authorization header. The plugin communicates with Keycloak using the OpenID Connect protocol.
